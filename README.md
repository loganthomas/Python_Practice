# Python_Practice

These are a number of practice problems I have compiled over the years to teach myself python. These range in complexity from “very simple” to “kinda hard.” Most of the initial commits were my first attempt at tackling the problem. Other modified commits were my attempt at being more “pythonic” or writing better code as I learned.
