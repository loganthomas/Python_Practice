# Python Practice Repo
> test update from dad
> These are a number of practice problems I have compiled over the years to teach myself python.  
> These problems range in complexity from *very simple* to *kinda hard*.  
>> Most of the initial commits were my first attempt at tackling the problem.  
>> Other modified commits were my attempt at being more "pythonic" or writing better code as I learned.
