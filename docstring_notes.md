# Personal Python Docstring notes
> A set of notes I have compiled pertaining to docstring formatting.  
> I find following the concepts laid out in [Google Style Python Docstrings](https://sphinxcontrib-napoleon.readthedocs.io/en/latest/example_google.html) and
[PEP 257](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/) most appealing.

## PEP 257 notes
- For consistency, always use `"""triple double quotes"""` around docstrings.
  - Use `r"""raw triple double quotes"""` if you use any backslashes in your docstrings.
